Governments worldwide impose taxes\nto   fund   critical   projects,   including   infrastructure,   public   education,   military   advancements,   law\nenforcement, and more. India has a well-developed tax structure with clearly demarcated authority\nbetween Central and State Governments and local bodies.  The authority of the government to levy\ntax in India is derived from the Constitution of India, which allocates the power to levy taxes to the\nCentral and State governments.   In India, the tax system is designed not only to generate revenue\nbut also to foster economic stability, promote equity, and drive national progress.  In last 10-15\nyears,   Indian   taxation   system   has   undergone   tremendous   reforms.   The   tax   rates   have   been\nrationalized and tax laws have been simplified resulting in better compliance, ease of tax payment\nand better enforcement.\n\n2.

Direct Taxes: Taxation at the Source-\n\nDirect taxes are levied directly on individuals and corporate entities. The responsibility of paying\nthese taxes lies solely with the taxpayer. This category of taxation is progressive, meaning the tax\nrate increases with income levels, ensuring a fair distribution of the tax burden. Key types of direct\ntaxes include:\n\na.   Income Tax:-  Governed by the  Income Tax Act 1961, this tax is imposed on the income of\nindividuals and entities. Rates vary based on income slabs, making it a progressive tax.
